/* TODO List:
 * 
 * Find a way to be able to update the likes and dislikes without the page reloading.
 * Additionally, I need to make it so that a user can only like or dislike a comment once.
 * 
 * Make the site look better.
 * 
 * I need to take away the option to post if you're not logged in + I need to figure out how logging in is going to work.
 * Additionally, make it so that only the poster of a comment is allowed to edit or delete it.
 * 
 * Fix the error page. Right now, whenever an error occurs, the program cannot accurately redirect the user to the error page.
 * 
 * Let's break down the addition of profiles into steps:
 * 1. I need to add an option to create a profile or log in.
 * 2. I should create a 'User' class with a boolean to determine if the user is logged in or not and the ID of whatever profile they are using.
 * 3. ???
 * 4. Profit.
 *
 * Now I need to figure out how to make the login page actually load.
