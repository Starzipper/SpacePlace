/* TODO List:
 * 
 * Find a way to be able to update the likes and dislikes without the page reloading.
 * Additionally, I need to make it so that a user can only like or dislike a comment once.
 * 
 * Make the site look better.
 * 
 * I need to take away the option to post if you're not logged in + I need to figure out how logging in is going to work.
 * Additionally, make it so that only the poster of a comment is allowed to edit or delete it.
 * 
 * Fix the error page. Right now, whenever an error occurs, the program cannot accurately redirect the user to the error page.
